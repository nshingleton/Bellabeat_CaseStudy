--Which feature is being most used by users; the distance tracker, sleep or weight?
--Here, I joined the tables for  “daily_activity”, “sleep_day”, and “weightLog_info” to get a total count of unique Ids for each table:
SELECT
Count(Distinct(Activity.Id)) AS TotalActivityId,
Count(Distinct(Sleep.Id)) AS TotalSleepId,
Count(Distinct(Weight.Id)) AS TotalWeightId
FROM `naomis-first-sandbox-project.fitabase_data.daily_activity` AS Activity
Full Outer JOIN
`naomis-first-sandbox-project.fitabase_data.sleep_day` AS Sleep
ON
Activity.Id = Sleep.Id
Full Outer JOIN
`naomis-first-sandbox-project.fitabase_data.weightLog_info` AS Weight
ON
Activity.Id = Weight.Id
